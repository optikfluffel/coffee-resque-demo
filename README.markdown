Coffee-Resque Demo
===

This will become a little Demo of [Coffee-Resque](https://github.com/technoweenie/coffee-resque "technoweenie/coffee-resque") together with [node.js](http://nodejs.org "node.js") and [express.js](http://expressjs.com "Express - node web framework").

How to try it? (on OS X and Linux)
---

I assume you have [node.js](http://nodejs.org/#download "node.js") and [npm](http://npmjs.org "npm - Node Package Manager") installed and ready to work.

* First you have to clone the repository to any place you like using something like:

```sh
git clone git://github.com/optikfluffel/coffee-resque-demo.git
```

* Then navigate into the new folder with ```cd coffee-resque-demo``` and install the dependencies using ```npm install```
* Now you simply have to start the redis-server with ```redis-server``` and the WebApp using ```npm start```
* After all that just go to you browser and check out the demo, usually at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000 "Coffee-Resque Demo")
